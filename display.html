								<b>Introduction</b><br>
								For this project, I built a music driven light up display. The objective of the design was to get a range from 0 freq - 1000+ freq. Four types of filters were used: lowpass, highpass and 2 bandpass filters each aimed at channeling different frequencies. The output of each filter was connected to a series LED lights that would light up when the given frequency fit the ranges of each filter. The frequency was provided through a 3.5mm audio jack but this alone didn't have enough voltage to power the LEDs and therefore it was paired with operational amplifiers and potentiometers to amplify the voltage.

							<b>Specifications</b><br>
							Filter Cutoff Frequencies:<br>
								- Lowpass: 200Hz<br>
								- 1st Bandpass: 200 - 500Hz<br>
								- 2nd Bandpass: 500 - 1000Hz<br>
								- Highpass: 1000Hz<br><br>

							With these cutoff frequencies I was able to calculate different resistor values for each corresponding filter. Then after intense simulation of each filter as well as the overall circuit, I finally built the circuit itself.
